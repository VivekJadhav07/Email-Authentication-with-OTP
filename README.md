# Email-Authentication-with-OTP
Created a PHP project that implemented
email authentication and OTP-based
authentication for user verification.
Developed a system to send OTP to the
userâ€™s email address, which they must enter
to complete the login process.
Used PHP and MySQL to manage user data
and store OTP records in the database for
validation.
